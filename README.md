wk 7 project
to reader:
This is my submission to the capstone project, Colmar Academy.
I know my code is not refined or finished, however it has taken me time to get 
the fundamentals down regarding flexbox.  Things finally started clicking last week, 
and I am happy with the overall course. I will continue to practice and start up my own
projects, and work on them over the summer. After which, I will see if I want to pursue 
dev more.

For this submission, I am just looking for tips/hints regarding flexbox, ie containers, children, grandchildren.
Thanks!

Damien Pulido
